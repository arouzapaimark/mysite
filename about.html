        <strong>SKILLS:</strong>
        <p>
            I have experience using Microsoft's primary applications, including Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.
            I learned how to write business letters, create impactful presentations, and organize data into tables.
            I also have experience with Python, having knowledge of conditionals and loops, as well as data structures like strings and lists.
            Finally, as I recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, I have knowledge in basic cybersecurity concepts.

            In high school, I took a course in Business Technology, where I learned how to use Microsoft Office from a business perspective.
            I also took courses in computer science and computer engineering, where I had brief exposure to Visual Basic and Scratch, and got to build my own circuit boards.
